Multi-author collaboration via github.

Within the movie folder you will find folders organized by directory name containing markdown files about their best movies.

## Formats & Naming Conventions

Director folder names and movie file names must be lower case with no punctuation and spaces replaced with dashes.

Movie files must start with a heading of the movies full proper name with all punctuation and fancy latin characters it might contain, followed by a synopsis paragraph.
